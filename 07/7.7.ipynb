    "> Suppose that the network of objects from Fig. 7.20 is managed by an incremental algorithm that uses the four lists _Unreached_, _Unscanned_, _Scanned_, and _Free_, as in Bakers's algorithm. To be specific, the _Unscanned_ list is manged as a queue, and when more than one object is to be placed on this list due to the scannning of one object, we do so in alphabetical order. Suppose also that we use write barriers to assure that no reachable object is made garbage. Starting with $A$ and $B$ on the _Unscanned_ list, suppose the following events occur:\n",
